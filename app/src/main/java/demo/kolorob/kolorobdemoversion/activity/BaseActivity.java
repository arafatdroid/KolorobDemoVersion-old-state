 *         This activity will hold the basic actions of every activity of the application,
 *         which may include log-in/session checks, drawer item initilization, overflow-menu configuration,
 *         toolbar setup and so on.
 *         Any special inheritance like ActionBarActivity, SherlockActivity, AppcompatActivity
 *         etc can also be configured using this single entry-point activity.
 *         <p/>
 *         For now, Kolorob demo app does not have any of such actions, which does not imply it WILL never ;)
